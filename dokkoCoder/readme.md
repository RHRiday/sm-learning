An online code editor for the web designers built with jQuery. To start working with the editor, start writing your code in the HTML panel and it will show dynamic output of the code in the OUTPUT panel. For
more control over the output, try the CSS and Javascript panels. Just click on the buttons above and the panels will be shown to be edited. These panels too are dynamic. Meaning, it will automatically update the OUTPUT panel as soon as you start to type something right in the corresponding panel.
